# Literature Review {#sec-literature-review}

This chapter demonstrates citation techniques and literature organization.



## How to Add References {#sec-add-refs}

### Step 1: Add to BibTeX File

Open `references.bib` or `MyLibrary.bib` and add entries:

```bibtex
@article{author2023,
  author = {Last, First and Second, Author},
  title = {Article Title},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {10},
  number = {2},
  pages = {123--145},
  doi = {10.1234/journal.2023.001}
}

@inproceedings{author2022,
  author = {Author, Name},
  title = {Conference Paper Title},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of Conference Name},
  year = {2022},
  pages = {45--58},
  publisher = {Publisher}
}

@book{author2021,
  author = {Author, Name},
  title = {Book Title},
  publisher = {Publisher Name},
  year = {2021},
  edition = {2nd}
}
```

## Literature Organization {#sec-lit-organization}

### Organizing by Topic

Organize your literature review by themes, not chronologically:

#### Machine Learning Approaches

Early work in machine learning @russell2020artificial established foundational algorithms. Recent advances by @smith2023machine and @jones2022deep have improved performance significantly. The framework proposed by @wilson2023framework provides a unified approach.

#### Statistical Methods

Traditional statistical approaches @kumar2022analysis remain relevant. However, modern techniques @martin2023algorithms offer better scalability for large datasets.

#### Distributed Computing

The rise of big data necessitates distributed frameworks @wang2022distributed. These systems enable processing of massive datasets efficiently.

### Identifying Research Gaps

After reviewing the literature, identify gaps:

1. **Gap 1:** While @smith2023machine achieved 85% accuracy, their method requires extensive training data.

2. **Gap 2:** Existing approaches [@jones2022deep; @wilson2023framework] have not addressed real-time constraints.

3. **Gap 3:** As noted by @kumar2022analysis, scalability remains an open challenge.



## Comparison Tables {#sec-lit-comparison}

## Critical Analysis {#sec-critical-analysis}

Don't just summarize - analyze critically:

**Strengths:**
- The method by @smith2023machine achieves high accuracy
- Approach of @wilson2023framework is computationally efficient
- @jones2022deep provides strong theoretical foundations

**Limitations:**
- Most studies [@smith2023machine; @jones2022deep] use limited datasets
- Real-time performance not addressed by @wilson2023framework  
- Scalability concerns raised by @kumar2022analysis remain unresolved

**Research Opportunities:**
Based on gaps identified above, this work proposes to...



## Connection to Your Work {#sec-connection}

End with how your work fits in:

While existing approaches [@smith2023machine; @jones2022deep; @wilson2023framework] have made significant progress, they share common limitations. This research addresses these gaps by proposing a novel framework that combines the strengths of @smith2023machine and @wilson2023framework while overcoming the scalability issues identified by @kumar2022analysis.

The methodology described in @sec-methodology builds upon these foundations to develop an improved approach.



**Remember:**
- Cite sources for all claims
- Group by themes, not chronologically
- Critically analyze, don't just summarize  
- Identify specific gaps your work addresses
- Use tables and diagrams to clarify comparisons
- Connect literature review to your methodology
